# ecommerce-mockup
This project is just for practice, a little cooperation with a UX/UI friend.

Considering this is not a big project, I'll use plain `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`, no webpack or libraries, unless I find it necessary.

[Here](https://www.figma.com/proto/vXQGm1fvXxKtfNDDbsYDC4/LeafyLiving?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=3%3A4&viewport=0%2C0%2C1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=3%3A4&show-proto-sidebar=1) is the mockup I'm going to use for this project. It's a landing page and the store section.

I still have to think what kind of approach I'm going to use. I didn't planned anything before creating this repository, so I'm going to scribble a little over the original design to organize everything and find the best way to keep the `CSS` as simple as possible. For the `Javascript` I'm probably going to use modules to prevent repetition, so I'll keep the `HTML` to the minimum.

The page needs to be reponsive. I didn't asked how it should look on mobile devices, so I'm going to try my own solution as a little challenge, then apply any necessary changes depending on the designer's opinion.
